Question 1 -- sortByStrings(s,t): Sort the letters in the string s by the order they occur in the string t. 
You can assume t will not have repetitive characters.
For s = "weather" and t = "therapyw", the output should be sortByString(s, t) = "theeraw".
For s = "good" and t = "odg", the output should be sortByString(s, t) = "oodg".
